            As an alternative theory, (and because Latin scholars do this sort of thing) someone
            tracked down a 1914 Latin edition of De Finibus which challenges McClintock's 15th century claims and
            suggests that the dawn of lorem ipsum was as recent as the 20th century. The 1914 Loeb Classical Library
            Edition ran out of room on page 34 for the Latin phrase “dolorem ipsum” (sorrow in itself). Thus, the
            truncated phrase leaves one page dangling with “do-”, while another begins with the now ubiquitous “lorem
            ipsum”.

            Whether a medieval typesetter chose to garble a well-known (but non-Biblical—that would have been
            sacrilegious) text, or whether a quirk in the 1914 Loeb Edition inspired a graphic designer, it's admittedly
            an odd way for Cicero to sail into the 21st century.
